                    <p>Hello! My name is Marjorie M. Anito, and I'm from Meycauayan, Bulacan. However, because my school is too far away, I'm currently living at Larlin Village with some of my friends.
                    This 29th of May, I'm going to be an adult and I don't know if I should be proud or not. Anyway, because I was born in Koronadal, South Cotabato, I genuinely speak Hiligaynon. Do you know where that is? Well, search it silly <3 </p>

                    <div class="tab-contents active-tab" id="skills">
                        <p>When our teacher assigned us a topic to report on in class when I was in the 10th grade, my classmates enjoyed how I communicated to my audience. This was my inspiration to have a confidence in front of the class. So having effective communication skills in reporting is one of my strongest asset. (But only if I had prepared my script, hehe). So I wish to take the BAB Course for this reason. But as you can see, I did not take it. But after some years, I enjoyed coding and it's an honor to learned at this course, especially in making a webpage. </p>

                    <div class="tab-contents" id="hobby">
                        <p>Since I was so impressed by individuals who are already professionals at it, practicing calligraphy has become one of my hobbies. I'm hoping to get better at calligraphy and eventually turn this into a business. It's entertaining and inspires me when others comment on my writing and think it's lovely. 
                        <br>
                        Also, procrastination is one of my hobbies. I had intended to do the work as soon as possible, but I am still unable to. I experienced some distractions, which is one of the causes. I'm working on not doing this because I don't want to stay this way forever hahaha.

                        <p>When I was a child, I really dreamed of becoming a Chef, so I always studied in school the things about cooking. But when I was in Grade 10, my relatives told me not to pursue that because it was expensive, so I should study about computers. So that's what I followed until now. But when I was in grade 10 up until now, aside from being a Chef, I also wanted to be a news anchor because I really like reporting in front of an audience.</p>
